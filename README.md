# ch8LargerNumbersWithArray

Create a project that fills an array with random numbers, asks the user for a number, then counts how many numbers in the array are larger than the user's input.

Create a class for generating random numbers (hint: see the projects in Module 4 that used random numbers to simulate rolling dice). It can be in the same file as the main function. Create an array with 25 elements and, using a function, fill each element with a random integer from 1 to 100. Using another function, display the array, with 5 numbers on a line. Ask the user to select a number in the range of 1 to 100; validate the input, looping to ask for valid data. Use a function to go through the array to count how many of the elements are larger than the user's input.

Here is an example of the results:

Here is an example with errors in the input:

Take screenshots similar to those seen here, one with no errors in input, one with errors in input.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
