# ch8LargerNumbersWithArray

Create a project that fills an array with random numbers, asks the user for a number, then counts how many numbers in the array are larger than the user's input.

Create a class for generating random numbers (hint: see the projects in Module 4 that used random numbers to simulate rolling dice). It can be in the same file as the main function. Create an array with 25 elements and, using a function, fill each element with a random integer from 1 to 100. Using another function, display the array, with 5 numbers on a line. Ask the user to select a number in the range of 1 to 100; validate the input, looping to ask for valid data. Use a function to go through the array to count how many of the elements are larger than the user's input.

Here is an example of the results:

Ch 8 Proj1 

Here is an example with errors in the input:

Ch 8 Proj1 errors

Take screenshots similar to those seen here, one with no errors in input, one with errors in input.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.
